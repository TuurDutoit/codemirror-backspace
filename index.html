    <h1>CodeMirror 6: Broken backspace</h1>
    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>
      Type an underscore pretty much anywhere in the document. You won't be able
      to backspace anymore until you type something else.
    </p>
    <p>Only on iOS devices; it works fine on Android and desktop.</p>
    <div id="editor-python"></div>
    <h2>SQL</h2>
    <p>
      After a valid query, add some nonsense and a quote, e.g.
      <code>SELECT 'SQL'; the"</code>. You won't be able to remove it at all. By
      tapping backspace repeatedly, you can sometimes make the cursor move back
      a few characters, but it won't remove the text.
    </p>
    <p>Broken on iOS, Android <em>and</em> desktop!</p>
